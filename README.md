# Color-Garden
##### Simply sit back, relax, and watch the block bounce around and generate random colors and sounds! Or use this for design inspiration and pick out some colors for your next app or site!

Welcome to another of my personal projects - Color Garden! This project resulted from a curiosity that lead me into learning to use the HTML5 canvas, the JavaScript requestAnimationFrame() function, and more. I decided I'd learn these concepts and build something fun to show off my progress. Here it is. 

For a list of current issues, look in the issues tab on the right --> 
One of my major goals with this app is to make the animations as smooth as possible and have the entire app work seamlessly on all modern browsers. 

----
For anyone interested in working on this, you need to run 
```
    npm install clipboard
```
or
```
    bower install clipboard 
```
to grab the clipboard.js dependency. 

Have fun!
